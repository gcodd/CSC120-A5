- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?

  I have some experience with association and aggregation from a previous course and I really enjoy how it makes your code so much neater. Learning about association also really helps solidify the transition between procedural programming and object-oriented programming in my head.
  
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
 
 To be honest I found this assignment pretty easy and just had fun doing it. The one issue I ran into was not being sure how to pass the message both into the Scarecrow object and the Banner object. I solved this problem by instantiating a Banner object in the class constructor (I know this isn't the best thing to do and in the future I would use a copy constructor). To people taking this course in the future, I would suggest being comfortable with moving code around and trying new things until you figure out what works. Coding is a big puzzle and sometimes you need to move the pieces around!
